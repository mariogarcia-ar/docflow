# Bitácora — execution log

> Status: **living**. Append-only, one entry per work session.

## What this file is

A chronological record of **execution**: which tasks ran, what the gates said, which
decisions were taken in code, and what was left stale. It is the place to record progress so
that a frozen artifact does not have to be edited to say "this is done".

## What this file is not

- **Not a plan artifact.** `docs/plan/README.md`, the subplans and the WBS are the decisions;
  where this log and one of them disagree, **the plan wins** and the disagreement is a defect
  of this file.
- **Not a decision document.** A decision that changes the plan is a plan revision
  (subplan + WBS in the same pass) or a note in `docs/feedback/`.
- **Not referenced from `docs/plan/README.md`.** Adding a row to that index is a plan
  revision; until one lands, this file is discovered by name and nothing depends on it.
- **Not a task tracker.** Task IDs, titles, effort and dependencies live in
  `docs/plan/issues/wbs-*.md`; an entry here reports their **status**, which the WBS files do
  not carry.

## How to append an entry

Copy the template, put the newest entry **last**, and keep every claim checkable: a command
with its output beats a sentence saying it worked.

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <phase> · <processor or task range>

**Delivered.** What now exists, by file.
**Tasks.** `ID` → done/partial, with what is missing.
**Gate evidence.** The four gates, as run, with their counts.
**Invariant evidence.** Which invariants were mutation-falsified, and where the four-field
record lives. A record whose mutation did not turn its test red is a defect.
**Decisions taken in code.** What a code decision had to settle, why, and which plan or
document it touches.
**Left stale (owner).** Documents this session did not edit and that now disagree with the
code, each with the owner who can fix it.
**Next.** The first thing the next session should pick up.

## 2026-09-25 — Phase 1 · `procesador-pdf` (`PDF-01` … `PDF-14`)

**Delivered.**

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/docflow/pdf/contracts.py` | request/result vocabulary; the failure kinds and the `None`-able engine version described below |
| `src/docflow/pdf/primitives/__init__.py` | the Poppler seam: the only module in the tree that calls `subprocess.run`, plus `inspect_pdf`, `extract_page`, `split_pdf`, `merge_pdfs`, `render_page_to_image`, `extract_text_from_page`, `extract_images_from_page` |
| `src/docflow/pdf/primitives/errors.py` | the typed failure a primitive raises and the entry points convert — the only exception this processor throws |
| `src/docflow/pdf/primitives/composition.py` | `PDFDocumentInfo`, `PDFPageData`, the named classification thresholds, `analyze_pdf_page`, `classify_pdf_page` |
| `src/docflow/pdf/primitives/publication.py` | atomic publication: `.tmp` → validate → rename, with cleanup on failure |
| `src/docflow/pdf/primitives/validation.py` | `validate_pdf` fail-fast, `validate_pdf_page_result`, `validate_pdf_result` |
| `src/docflow/pdf/entrypoints.py` | `process_pdf` and `process_pdf_page`, the page loop, the artifact tree, `metadata.json` payloads |
| `tests/fixtures/pdf/pdf_sample_{text,image,mixed}.pdf`, `pdf_corrupt.pdf` | the committed samples, built deterministically by `build_samples.py` (standard library only) |
| `tests/fakes/engines/fake_poppler.py` | the in-memory Poppler double, native-shaped and injected at the seam |
| `tests/pdf/**` | one test module per source module, the happy path, the invariants, the failure paths |

`utils/` and `helpers/` stay empty, as resolved decision 5 of the subplan requires.

**Tasks.** All fourteen are done, in the subplan's waves:

| Wave | Tasks | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Foundations | `PDF-01`, `PDF-02` | done |
| 2 — Primitives | `PDF-03` … `PDF-08`, `PDF-14` | done |
| 3 — Composition | `PDF-09`, `PDF-10` | done |
| 4 — Hardening | `PDF-11`, `PDF-12`, `PDF-13` | done |

`merge_pdfs` (`PDF-04`) is implemented and tested but composed nowhere: the subplan defers it
off the happy path, so it carries a `# TODO: [MVP]`.

**Gate evidence.**

```
pytest                     143 passed
ruff check .               All checks passed!
ruff format --check .      68 files already formatted
pylint src tests           10.00/10
```

The phase exit is owned by `PDF-13`, and it includes the no-engine rule. With the binaries off
the `PATH`, the whole suite is still green — the measurement is the subprocess's own
environment, so the double is the only thing that answered:

```
env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin "$(which python)" -m pytest -q    143 passed
command -v pdfinfo                                          not reachable
```

**Invariant evidence.** Four invariants were mutation-falsified this session — page
completeness, immutable input, classification vocabulary & purity, and no-silent-failure. Each
was mutated, observed red, restored, and observed green, in the four-field shape
`docs/plan/README.md` §7 fixes. **The canonical records live in the root `README.md`** (the
table under "Rules that will bite you"), because that is where `GEN-16` audits them; this
entry does not restate them, so there is one copy and not two.

**Decisions taken in code.**

1. **`PDFErrorType` follows the subplan's ten names.** The code had drifted to eleven
   (`MISSING_FILE`, `PAGE_OUT_OF_RANGE`, `WRITE_ERROR`); `PDF-01` aligns it, mirroring the
   `OCRErrorType` decision, and a guard test restates the list so a drift turns red. Out of
   range lands on `INVALID_INPUT` when it is decided before the engine call and on
   `PAGE_EXTRACTION_ERROR` when the engine rejects the range; a write failure is `IO_ERROR`.
2. **`engine_version` is `str | None`.** A pre-engine failure (missing, unsupported, encrypted
   or corrupt document) reaches no engine call, so there is no version; `None` states that
   instead of a placeholder that reads like one.
3. **A page's failures live in `PDFPageValidation.errors`.** No `errors` field was added to
   `PDFPageResult`: a stage failure is precisely what the page's validation reports, and the
   record already carries the typed kind and the `recoverable` flag.
4. **`process_pdf_page` inspects the document once for the page's geometry.** The entry-point
   signature is frozen and cannot carry it, and the page has to work standalone. Inside a
   document run that is one extra `pdfinfo` per page, tagged `# TODO: [MVP]` to be replaced
   once the contract can pass the inspected document down.
5. **`processing_key` is computed by the processor** from the documented formula, because
   every artifact `metadata.json` must record it (`docflow.identities`) while its owner
   `ORC-02` is Phase 2. Tagged `# TODO: [MVP]` to reconcile the two at Phase 2.
6. **The fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/pdf/`, with their builder committed.** The subplan
   writes `fixtures/pdf_sample_*.pdf`; the repository's fixture root is `tests/fixtures/`, so
   the samples sit one level down. `build_samples.py` is standard library only and
   deterministic, so a fixture can be regenerated and reviewed as a diff.
7. **`tests/test_skeleton.py`'s Phase-0 stub check now covers the processors still stubbed.**
   `pdf` no longer raises, so the check points at `workflow`, `image`, `ocr` and `llm`; it
   stays a check rather than being deleted.

**Left stale (owner).** No pre-existing file under `docs/plan/`, `docs/idea/` or
`docs/feedback/` was edited — this log is the only thing added. These now disagree with the
code and need their owner:

| Document | What is stale | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/3party/poppler.md` §G (and its drift log §K) | the engine-signal table's right-hand column uses the eleven old names, and its "divergence to report" note no longer applies | dossier owner |
| `tests/fixtures/manifest.json` | does not know the `pdf/` folder or its four files; there is no builder in the tree to re-run | fixture owner |
| `docs/plan/issues/wbs-procesador-pdf.md` | header and §2 still say `NOT_STARTED` for all fourteen tasks; a WBS is a frozen artifact, so flipping it is a plan revision, not a code edit | plan owner |
| `README.md`, phase table | the Phase 5 row still lists `PDF-14` / `IMG-15` / `OCR-14` as lab tools; `docs/feedback/no-tests-on-third-parties.md` repurposed them as the engine doubles | plan owner |

**Next.** Phase 1 continues with `image` (`IMG-01`…`IMG-14`), then `ocr` and `llm`. `pdf` is
the worked example to copy: `src/docflow/pdf/` for the layout, `tests/pdf/` for the test shape,
and `tests/fakes/engines/fake_poppler.py` for a double that models the engine's native surface
rather than our types. The three follow-ups tagged in code — the per-page re-inspection, the
processor-local `processing_key`, and the double's re-check on a pin bump — are the first
things Phase 2 and the Release gate will want.
